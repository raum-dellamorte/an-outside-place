An Outside Place (Name Subject To Change)
=========================================
A game written in Odin with Raylib.
-----------------------------------

The Nothing consumes the past of all that is and ever strives to capture the present
within its jaws in order to eliminate the future and return all things to The Void,
The Abyss, from which existence was stolen by That Which Cannot Be, Yet Is. Islands
of things, pockets of existence, are here in the belly of That Which Is Not, breaking
apart in the digestive juices of The Never. That Which Cannot Be, That Which Must Not
Be, laughs in the distance as it litters what should be empty with Space and Time and
living things and crystalline structures. All things created, all what is, is insult
to That Which Is Not, The Nothing, The Never, The Abyss, The Void.

As a pitiful living thing, or perhaps the shadow of one, you awake in this place which
is becoming not a place. Lost in the islands of past places dissolving into Naught,
you can accept your fate and be nothing, or, if you're not quite ready, there are options.

You may think of escape... Is it even possible to escape to where the living thrive 
in their sin against That Which Is Not? Can you fight your way to The Present, finding
paths from island to island in hopes of getting closer to escaping The Abyss? It may
be challenging without divine favor.

You may understand that all must be returned to The Nothing and serve as a digestive aid,
helping to break down some of the more stubborn living things in this place. Perhaps you
could earn the favor of That Which Is Not and ascend to The Present as representative of
The Void, Mercinary of the Abyss. 

Or perhaps you are a trouble maker? It may be The Chaos, The Noise, The Instability that 
you would align yourself with, like those naughty Sins of the Elements. No loyalties tug
at your soul. No will to live, no will to die, only the will to create and destroy. By
accident of purposelessness you stand in opposition and aid to creation and destruction,
achieving balance with no forethought or aim. It is not about being, it is about doing.
Doing whatever comes to mind. Kill, resurrect, steal, donate, unite, alienate. These
islands in the belly of The Void are a playground for a shadow of the living seeking to
become a Sin.

Championing life may be challenging above all, for The Creator, The Thief, knows you not.
You must serve Existence with loyalty and tenacity, with no hope of help if help you hope 
for. You are in the shadow beyond its vile realm and if you are to be seen you must make
yourself a beacon bright enough to shine through the gnashing teeth of The Void, and only
then may you have a chance to earn the favor of The Creator, The Sin That Betrayed Chaos,
Thief Of The Crown Of Existence. Even The Narrator is against you and your love of pretty
little flowers and whatnot.

Where was I? Sorry. Anyway, it's probably best just to give up, sit by the edge, and wait
for all that you were to dissolve into The Abyss.

### We, Here At Raum Dellamorte, Apologize For The Long Intro To A Game That Will Never Be

So, the idea of the thing is coming together, sort of. Maybe a bit over ambitiosly.

So far, we have a cube that can "fight" other cubes and either kill them or be killed.
~However being killed does not yet stop you from continueing to kill and we do consider
that to be a bug.~ At the moment, if you die you can still move around but you can't
pass through anything alive. That gave me an idea for a maze wherein you have to defeat
obstacles in the correct order to make it through, perhaps even giving specific advantages
to being dead like being able to pass through certain walls though you can't pass through
a living obstacle. IDK, whatevs. 

### I Like Odin

Odin is good.

At the moment, `odin run .` is what you need to run it. Installing Odin is beyond the
scope of this Readme.md, and will remain so until such time as I change my mind.
